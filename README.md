# CExamplesBasic

This is a repository for basic examples in c++.  All .cc files are self-contained and can be compiled with the following:
```
g++ NAME.cc -o NAME
```

and run:
```
./NAME
```

where NAME is the name of the file you wish to compile.  For example to compile the first example:
```
g++ AHelloWorld.cc -o AHelloWorld
```

and run:
```
./AHelloWorld
```


## Order

The examples are in alphabetical order, starting with A, and build somewhat on each other.
